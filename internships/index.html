<p><div class="heading">User Insights, Omada Health     <div class="date">Summer 2015</div></div>
<i>Represented the voice of the user (with data and words) on the Product Team at a leading digital health startup.</i>


<p>I redesigned and ran two user surveys in the two phases of Omada's flagship product, and delivered weekly updates and recommendations for metrics like user satisfaction, NPS, and feature ratings. With the survey redesign, CTR and total response rate improved by more than 5%. From survey data, I developed profiles for satisfied and unsatisfied users, and analyzed quantitative and qualitative feedback to determine what drove satisfaction. In cooperation with the Product and Engineering teams, I incorporated this feedback into upcoming product sprints and 'MVP' feature split tests.</p>

Other projects:
<ul>
	<li>Worked with account management to convert user feedback into meaningful client reports</li>
	<li>Worked with the front-end engineering team on HTML/ERB curriculum; wrote Pivotal Tracker stories for bugs and features</li>
	<li>Conducted qualitative phone interviews to get 'first impressions' for new product concepts</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="heading">Product Development, Gannett   <div class="date">Summer 2014 - Spring 2015</div></div>
<i>Built a mobile app from scratch (user interviews, wireframing, business model, marketing launch) with the innovation department of a Fortune 500 media company.</i>

<p>Gannett gave my team of four 8 weeks to pitch a new mobile product. We started with user insights from previous company data, qualitative user interviews, and 'intercepts' with our target users for feedback on basic paper prototypes. I took responsibility for competitive research and for designing our excel business model to validate our launch strategy and budget proposal. Our pitch was successful -- we received funding from the CEO -- and I was re-hired for an additional 6 months to help with the beta launch of our idea.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Created wireframes to guide UX development</li>
	<li>Worked with development team on beta testing</li>
	<li>Designed marketing strategy for beta launch</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="heading">Product Marketing, Aviso      <div class="date">Summer 2014</div></div>
<i>Supported the first formal product launch for a Series B business analytics company.</i>



<p>As the only marketing 'hire' aside from the CMO, I touched everything product marketing at Aviso. My favorite project was creating a competitive framework that helped us evaluate new players in business analytics -- analyzing their messaging strategy, features, target users, and largest customers.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Created sales enablement documents mapping product features to workflows of our key user personas</li>
	<li>Wrote user-facing product guides and demand gen marketing pieces for Sales Execs</li>
	<li>Refined our messaging and web design to speak to enterprise software users and break away from competition</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="heading">Product Marketing, HumanAPI  <div class="date">Summer 2013, Spring 2015</div></div>
<i>Saw a little bit of everything as '#3' at a new Health IT startup.</i>

<p>For a few months in the early days of HumanAPI, I was the operations team. I researched health IT, wearables, and sensor companies and divided them up into competitors, potential partners, and potential customers. I combed through VC and Angel investors to find our most likely matches. I also performed misc. other tasks (whatever had to be done):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read all the relevant health tech news every morning, and increased our Twitter following 10x through blog posts and curation of the top health tech news articles</li>
	<li>Wrote marketing pieces for the HumanAPI blog to reinforce our value propositions</li>
	<li>Wrote grant proposals for Health IT innovation projects</li>
	<br>
</ul></p>
