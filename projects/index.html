<p><div class="heading">Bond: Digital Tools for Working Parents (Ongoing)</div>
My team took first place in a pitching competition for ME115C: Business Design. We won a little bit of funding from Pejman-Mar Ventures to pursue a family of iOS apps on the theme of 'digital tools for working parents' -- more to come!</p>


<p><div class="heading">SHIFT: Enabling Student Health Tech Innovation (Ongoing)</div>
	<a href="shift.stanford.edu"><u>shift.stanford.edu</u></a><br>
SHIFT connects student developers, entrepreneurs, and pre-meds with real opportunities in health tech through industry projects and round-table discussions with leaders in the space.
In Spring 2015, I led one of our first industry projects: interviewing doctors and other medical professionals to uncover pain points associated with prior authorization and ICD coding practices. Check out some of our key findings!

I currently help source projects from local health tech companies by building relationships through email outreach and refining company project proposals.</p>


<p><div class="heading">Design for America: Leading Design Teams with Social Impact Initiatives (2013-2015)</div>
<a href="dfa.stanford.edu"><u>dfa.stanford.edu</u></a><br>
Design for America is a national organization composed of student teams using the design process to create products and services with meaningful local impact. 

I have led teams addressing medication adherence and worker safety. It's all about design process:
- Through local stakeholder interviews, we narrow our project scope from a large issue like "worker safety" to a local painpoint like "effective onboarding of new and rotating kitchen workers." 
- We formulate a series of "How Might We" statements and use these to brainstorm potential solutions.
- We prototype these solutions and test them with local community partners. In our Worker Safety project, we prototyped a series of magnets</p>

<p><div class="heading">Kindred Britain: Visualizing Famous British Genealogies (2013)</div>
<a href="kindred.stanford.edu"><u>kindred.stanford.edu</u></a><br>
Kindred Britain is a data visualization project seeking to highlight surprising genealogical connections from British history. The data has many different facets that do not lend themselves well to verbal description, and target users are in an older, academic audience unlikely to be familiar with the technology supporting the site. I worked as a UX Research assistant on an interdisciplinary team with developers, academic researchers, and designers.
